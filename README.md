# Job Matching and Candidate Analysis Tool

This tool uses Streamlit, Pinecone, and Google Generative AI to analyze job descriptions, candidate resumes, and interview videos to identify the best job-candidate match. The system processes job descriptions, resumes, and video content, then merges the results to evaluate how well a candidate aligns with a particular role.

## Features

- **Job Matching**: Compares candidate resumes and videos against job descriptions to find the best match.
- **LLM Analysis**: Utilizes Google Generative AI for structured analysis of resumes and videos.
- **Similarity Search**: Uses Pinecone to store job descriptions and retrieve the closest match based on the candidate's profile.
